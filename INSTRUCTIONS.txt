Features that do not appear in the video
You have watched our video. But wait, thereâ€™s more!
Our application encrypts usernames and passwords, so if you open the customers or the employees JSON file, you will see the encrypted stored credentials, rather than the actual ones we use to log in. They are decrypted on the fly, when the application is authenticating users.
Furthermore, customers can email themselves a confirmation of their booking from the summary screen that appears when they click on Book Seat and make a booking. Check your UCL email account!

Javadoc files
in doc folder

Important note
The res folder needs to be located in the same path/directory as the Eclipse workspace folder (called zcinema) and the jar file, so that they can find it. It should not be inside the actual project folder with the source code though. If it gets moved to a different location, the application will no longer work.
